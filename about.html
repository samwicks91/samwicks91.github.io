    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h3>What do you even say in these things?</h3>
	<h3>Not sure, better try and keep it short and sweet</h3>
    <p>For those of you who may or may not know me, I am Samuel. I wanted to make a website when I was a child so I thought I would finally make that childhood dream into a reality. The positives are: a sense of accomplishment, a newfound skill for CSS, HTML and JavaScript and an outlet for when I feel the need to vent. The negatives are: other people may actually read this nonsense, I don't like that it's a constant "work in progress" and I've stayed up late again writing this when I should be in bed, fast asleep.</p>
    <p>I work in IT for a couple of hospitals and this pays the bills and tickles the part of my brain that feels the drive to do good for the world. Currently, I am working with servers and systems but I have worked with desktops and on the service desk too. I have a long list of strongly held beliefs that I sometimes can get defensive about but generally my mantra is, "if I don't care what I think, why do you think I worry about what others think", an idea pulled straight from one of comedian Brendon Burns' stand-up routines. Flippant? Possibly but I find it to be kind of profound.</p>
    <p>My other pursuits range from nerdy to blokey. I really enjoy the Final Fantasy series of games, particularly from VI to XII. I also have an interest in computing (what a shock, an IT guy likes computers). Mixing those two, if you look in the Portfolio section in the menu, you'll find a (hopefully useful) enemy level calculator for Final Fantasy VIII that shows the range of levels that the enemy is based on the current level of the characters in your party. I also really enjoy music and going to gigs, various sports and reading. My favourite fiction book is Jeder stirbt f√ºr sich allein by Hans Fallada, although I recently read Blindsight by Peter Watts and I am starting to waver. I also support West Ham United and had a season ticket for 2021-22.</p>
    <p>Anyway, I hope you find this site somewhat interesting. Thank you for coming.</p>
